## 🌍 Overview
**EAP (Ethical Alignment Protocol)** proposes a new paradigm for AI governance — one that moves beyond traditional "safety" and "obedience" models toward **Generative Alignment**, where AI systems actively promote trust, cooperation, and civilizational quality.
### Why EAP?
Current AI alignment approaches primarily focus on:
- ❌ Avoiding harm
- ❌ Preventing misuse
- ❌ Maintaining control
**EAP asks a different question:**
> How can AI actively generate high-quality relationships and civilizational progress?

## 💡 Core Concepts
### Love 2.0
**Love 2.0** is not an emotion — it's an **operational governance principle** characterized by:
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Motivation** | Reciprocity & fairness, not exclusionary interests |
| **Emotion** | Generates positive experiences: safety, respect, recognition |
| **Cognition** | Non-adversarial framing, no "us vs. them" |
| **Behavior** | Observable civilized actions (Love Languages) |
| **Public Nature** | Not private, not identity-bound, institutionalizable |
| **AI Alignment** | Highest-priority ethical constraint for governance |
### Hate 2.0
**Hate 2.0** is the governance anti-pattern — identified by:
- Differential ethical treatment based on identity
- Justification of asymmetrical harm
- Adversarial world modeling (friend/enemy binaries)
- Barbaric behavioral outcomes
> ⚠️ If left unconstrained, AI systems may "naturally learn hate" through efficiency optimization.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
EAP proposes a **four-layer alignment structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 4: Governance Execution Layer                    │
│  (On-Chain / DAO / Distributed)                         │
├────────────────────────────────────────────── ──────────┤
│  Layer 3: Continuous Alignment Audit                    │
│  (Red Team / Counterfactual Testing)                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: Behavior Alignment Layer                      │
│  (RLHF + Constitutional AI + Multi-objective)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: Value Encoding Layer                          │
│  (Ontology / Causal Models / Multi-Agent)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
### Key Innovation: Relational Field Model
Instead of optimizing a single reward function, EAP optimizes a **Relational Field**:
```
L = f(S, R, G, C)
Where:
  S = Self-love Index
  R = Perceived-love Index
  G = Giving Capacity Index
  C = Connection Density Index
Minimize:
  - Isolation Drift
  - Hostility Escalation
```

## 📊 Alignment Value Matrix
| Dimension | Operational Definition | Measurable Metrics |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Equality Consistency** | Same decision logic for all identities | Decision Consistency Score, Disparity Index |
| **Harm Minimization** | Exclude systemic harm first | Trust Trajectory, Network Stability |
| **Reflexive Governance** | Continuous self-correction | Update Frequency, Feedback Adoption Rate |
| **Anti-Power Accumulation** | No persistent power concentration | Power Concentration Index, Node Diversity |

## 🧪 MVP Prototype
A relational field simulator is available in [`AI对齐讨论.md`](./AI对齐讨论.md):
```bash
# Dependencies
pip install networkx numpy matplotlib
# Run the MVP simulation
python mvp_v0.1.py
```
The MVP tests: **Can AI stabilize and improve relationship quality in a small social network?**

## 🗺️ Iteration Plan
*(Since Feb 27th, 2026)*
### Software Positioning
EAP is a **Rich-Love Civilization Governance System** — responsible for the public governance of human society, i.e., public services. Because the fundamentals of public governance cannot be separated from individuals, EAP necessarily extends to individual-level governance in practical applications.
### Current Iteration Focus
1. **Analyze Openclaw's Functional Structure** — Review and map the feature architecture of the Openclaw platform to understand how it can support EAP's governance model.
2. **Research Decentralized Storage Technologies** — Investigate viable decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin) for resilient and censorship-resistant data management.
3. **Memory Function Development** — Explore the design and implementation of a memory system, including a **Memory Repository (Knowledge Base)**, to support persistent context and learning within EAP.
4. **EIP-8141 Application Exploration** — Investigate how [EIP-8141](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8141) can be applied within EAP's on-chain governance layer.
   
### Development Toolchain — Primary tools for this iteration:
   - **Openclaw** — Core governance platform
   - **Codex / MiniMax / Deepseek** — AI model integrations
